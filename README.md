# CS Labs

The Universal Competitive Programming Platform.

## Idea

The idea is to build an open-source, dockerized, feature-rich platform for everyone's competitive programming needs. With a github-like backend for storing the problems, with extensive support for configuring your testing, dependencies and environment setup. Using docker, we can create an environment that is suited exactly for the problem's needs, which runs on any platform in a predictable way. No more unexplained server-side compilation errors!

## The Plan

I'm completely open to suggestions for how the implementation is going to work, what tech stack should be used for the website, among everything else. Drop a PR, or [contact me](https://github.com/tusharsadhwani) to see what we can do with this project.
